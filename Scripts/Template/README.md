## How to use

Script has single command to use.
You can configure almost all script settings though SL Chatbot UI.
The other ones you can change directly in script directory config (`*_config.py`) or script file.

**Note:** prefer to reload script manually if you change any settings because SL Chatbot can skip settings reload for script sometimes!

In addition, notice that all errors will be caught and logged.
So, if bot doesn't send response, check "Logs" or "Errors" tab in SL Chatbot UI.

**Note:** documentation contains default command names and permissions but you can change script settings.
