## How to use

Script has single command to use.
You can configure almost all script settings though SL Chatbot UI.
The other ones you can change directly in script directory config (`config.py`) or script file.

In addition, notice that all errors will be caught and logged.
So, if bot doesn't send response, check "Logs" or "Errors" tab in SL Chatbot UI.

**Note:** documentation contains default command names and permissions but you can change script settings.
