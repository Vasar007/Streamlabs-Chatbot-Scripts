# Streamlabs-Chatbot-Scripts

This repository contains some useful Streamlabs Chatbot (SL Chatbot) scripts.

## Available scripts

- [Boilerplate](Scripts/Boilerplate) — basic boilerplate script to play with.
- [Score](Scripts/Score) — script that adds score counter between two opponents.

## How to install any script

1. Download repository. You can download target script from [Releases](Releases). In that case, go to the step 4.
2. Go to the target script directory (starting from the root where SCRIPT_StreamlabsSystem is located).
   Example: `Streamlabs-Chatbot-Scripts/Scripts/Score`
3. Create a ZIP archive for target script directory.
4. Open SL Chatbot, go to the "Script" tab, click "Import" and select ZIP archive with script directory.
5. If script will import successfully, you're good to go!
   Otherwise, check "Errors" and "Logs" tabs.

If you're having trouble with loading scripts in the SL Chatbot, see: [Scripts Explained video](youtube.com/watch?v=l3FBpY-0880)

Finally, feel free to create new Issue or contact me directly (vasar007@yandex.ru) if you have any question or problems.

## How to use

You don't really need to (and can, because the user config in SL Chatbot is still buggy) configure much.
Just enable script in your stream and have fun!
